# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Resources
* Coursera: UCSD Data Structures and Java (3 courses): (more on java)
* Princeton: Algorithms (coursera) (Java): book and code 
* Berkeley: CS61B (Java) (more on lectures)
* Stanford: CS 106B (C++) --> how to implement data structures in C++ (with templates)

## Topics:
* Data structures and Algorithms: mainly forcus on implementation with Java and then in C++
* Algorithm design: (quick implementation in Python):
	* brute force/ exhautive search: eg
	* backtracking
	* greedy: eg. MST, Dijatra
	* devide and conquer: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
	* dynamic progrmming: FFT
	* some theory: P, NP, NP complete, 
* Algorithm design resources: 	
	* book of Lelitin: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
	* Rice univercity (Algorithmic thinking)
	* MIT (some lectures)
	* coursera and stanford (certificates)
